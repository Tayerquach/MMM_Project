🥚 EggBuddy Café: Creamier with Egg Coffee ☕
========================
EggBuddy Café, a trendy coffee shop in Dublin, has been growing in popularity. However, its success is not only about great coffee but also about understanding demand and making smart marketing decisions across media channels. With these, EggBuddy can track and optimize sales while accounting for trend, seasonality, demand, and marketing effects.

## Understanding Demand and Marketing Effect
EggBuddy's sales data shows three key patterns:

1. 📈 Trend Component (Long-Term Growth): Over time, sales have increased due to brand recognition and customer loyalty.

2. 🔄 Seasonal Component (Repeating Daily & Weekly Patterns)

* Morning spikes on weekdays: Office workers grab coffee before work.
* Weekend brunch rush: Customers linger longer and order more.
* Seasonal drinks boost sales: Egg Coffee with Cinnamon in fall 🍁, Egg Coffee with Coconut Milk in summer 🥥, and Hot Egg Coffee in winter ❄️.

3. Creating Demand Through Marketing
While trend and seasonality naturally shape demand, EggBuddy also actively creates demand through targeted marketing campaigns on:

    * 📺 TV ads (for brand awareness)

    * 📲 Social media ads (for engagement)

    * 🔍 Search ads (for capturing intent)

**Note**: EggBuddy **cannot directly measure** "how much people want their coffee", thus, we can use demand proxies in the simulated data.

Since sales are influenced by both real demand and marketing spend, the model needs to account for both separately.

* How Each Channel Contributes to Sales

| Channel               | Effect on Sales                         | Characteristics                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 📺 TV Ads            | Drives long-term awareness 📢       | Slow impact, but builds brand recognition. |
| 📲 Social Media Ads  | Engages and reminds customers 💬   | Short-term, good for promotions.         |
| 🔍 Search Ads       | Captures people actively looking for the egg coffee 🥚 ☕ | High-intent, immediate impact. |


* TV ads do not immediately bring customers, but they help people remember BrewBuddy later.
* Social media ads create buzz and get people talking.
* Search ads convert customers who are already looking for coffee immediately.
